   <title>Minimal requirements</title>
   <para>As was mentioned in Section 1.1 Downloading Distribution, the main requirement is having
      Java Development Kit version 8 installed in your environment. Other requirements on the
      hardware depend on what you expect from PerfCake. The memory and CPU power demands depand
      mainly on your performance scenario.</para>
   <para>Some components also work only with an active Internet connection. For example chart output
      is based on Google Charts and they do not work offline. We are considering to provide a
      different solution and make ParfCake work completely offline in the future.</para>
