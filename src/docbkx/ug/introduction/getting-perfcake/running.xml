   <title>Running PerfCake</title>
   <para>There are multiple ways of running PerfCake. In the case you have just donwloaded and
      unpacked the binary distribution, you can find a shell script and a Windows bat script in the
      $PERFCAKE_HOME/bin directory. These are executables that can find your JDK and run PerfCake
      properly. The scripts were tested on Linux, Windows and MacOS (in this case, some command line
      tweaking might be necessary).</para>
   <para>In case of building from source code, please refer to the Developers' Guide for more
      instructions. Basically, the easiest way is to create the binary distribution from source code
      and follow the usual steps. It is also possible to run PerfCake directly by invoking the java
      command but this needs to take care of the classpath configuration.</para>
   <para>It is also possible to run PerfCake using a Maven plugin or its API. These ways are
      described either in the Developers' Guide or will be presented in the chapter with use
      cases.</para>
