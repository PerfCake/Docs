   <title>Downloading distribution</title>
   <para>The best way to obtain a complete distribution of PerfCake is at
      <link xlink:href="https://www.perfcake.org/download/"/>. There you can find the latest stable binary release in multiple
      formats.
   </para>
   <para>We assume that you already have Java installed. For the best performance of PerfCake, we
      need to ask you to install Java Development Kit (JDK) as we compile some classes dynamically
      during test execution. This cannot be done just with Java Runtime Environment (JRE). We also
      do not provide distributions with Java included in them. There are two simple reasons - first,
      you are likely to already have one, second, we do not have enough time to maintain and test
      such distributions.
   </para>
   <para>If you are brave enough, you can even try our nightly builds from
      <link xlink:href="https://perfcake.ci.cloudbees.com/job/PerfCake-devel/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/perfcake/target/"/>.
   </para>
   <para>We try not to commit broken code and the nightly builds contain all the newest features.
      However, there are no guarantees and the features are usually not yet documented. You would
      need to have a look in the source code to be able to fully use them.
   </para>
   <para>Once you have downloaded your favourite build file, you can just uncompress (unzip,
      untar...) it in a directory you like. This is your complete installation and the location is
      further referenced as $PERFCAKE_HOME.
