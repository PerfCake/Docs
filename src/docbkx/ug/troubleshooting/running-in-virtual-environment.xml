   <title>Running in Virtual Environment</title>
   <para>In a virtual environment, the host might have some system level tweaks to optimize its
      performance. Among others, some of the operating system real timer ticks or PIT/HPET timers
      might be skipped. This can lead in a poor PerfCake time measurement resolution. Pay close
      attention to the time benchmark executed during PerfCake startup. This reveals the maximal
      performance PerfCake is able to measure. All faster systems will look like having an infinite
      performance to PerfCake. PerfCake will also start displaying warning when such a speed is
      achieved and the test results will be flawed.</para>
