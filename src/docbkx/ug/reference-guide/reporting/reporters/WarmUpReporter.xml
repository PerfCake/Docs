   <title>WarmUpReporter</title>
   <para>The reporter is able to determine when the tested system is warmed up. The warming is
      enabled/disabled by the presence of enabled WarmUpReporter in the scenario. It does not
      publish any results to destinations. The minimal iterations count and the warm-up period
      duration can be tweaked by the respective properties <code>minimalWarmUpCount</code> with the
      default value of 10,000 and <code>minimalWarmUpDuration</code> with the default value of
      15,000 ms). </para>
   <para>The reporter internally keeps track of current throughput - each second checks the number
      of processed iterations and computes the current throughput as the difference in number of
      iterations per checking period (second). It also remembers the current throughput from the
      previous checking period to calculate a difference in throughput. The throughput is considered
      NOT changing in time "much" when the relative difference in current throughput between the
      current checking period and the previous one is less than <code>relativeThreshold</code> value
      or the absolute difference in current throughput between the current checking period and the
      previous one is less than <code>absoluteThreshold</code> value.</para>
   <para>Normally, the maximal length of the warm-up period is determined by the length of the
      performance test itself. This can be further limited (by using
         <code>maximalWarmUpDuration</code> and <code>maximalWarmUpType</code> properties) for the
      test not to waste time when the system under test cannot get warmed-up within a reasonable
      time frame. </para>
   <para>The system is considered warmed up when all of the following conditions are satisfied: The current throughput
      is not changing much over the time, the minimal iterations count has been executed and the
      minimal duration from the very start has exceeded.

      <para>In the example above the system would be considered warmed up when at least 1000 iterations is processed AND the scenario is executed for at least
         10 seconds AND, the relative change in the throughput is less then 0.5% or the absolute change in throughput is less than 0.5 iterations per second.
