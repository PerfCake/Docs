   <title>Performance scenario definition</title>
   <para>Scenario is a receipt for telling PerfCake what to do. You can specify how PerfCake would
      generate load by configuring a generator, where and what to send by defining a sender and
      messages. To get any measured results such as an average throughput or a memory usage you can
      use reporting capabilities. To check that the responses are correct a validation is available
      for you to set in the scenario. There is also a possibility to specify scenario meta-data by
      setting the scenario's properties. </para>
