   <title>Handling issues during excution</title>
   <para>PerfCake tries to overcome as many issues as it can. For a 100% validity of your performance test results,
      always make sure there are no warning or errors in the log. Such issues can be a problem with message template
      (the template isused without being parsed), a reporter with smaller reporting period than 500ms (the reporter is skipped) etc.
      More critical issues are reported with a non-zero exit code. See section Exit codes.
