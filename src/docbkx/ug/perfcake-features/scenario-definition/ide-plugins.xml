   <title>IDE plugins</title>
   <para>So far we have prepared preliminary versions of plugins for Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea. Some
      efforts were done for NetBeans as well. None of the plugins is stable enough at the moment. We
      are in a search of a brave contributor who could consolidate all the plugins and make them
      stable and user friendly.</para>
   <para>If you want to go wild, try to search the default repositories of your IDE. This comes with
      no guarantees at the moment.</para>
