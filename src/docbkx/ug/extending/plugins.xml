   <para>PerfCake has the ability to extend its functionality by adding plugins - new custom
      components such as senders, generators, reporters, destinations or validators. <footnote>

   <para>To add a new component to PerfCake, all you need to do is to take the jar file with the
      packaged component (along with all its dependencies) and place them in the
         <code>$PERFCAKE_HOME/lib/plugins</code> directory. </para>
