      PerfCake has the ability to extend its functionality by adding plugins - new custom components such as senders, generators, reporters, destinations or validators.

      If you want to add a new component to be used by PerfCake, all you need to do is to take the jar file,
      where the component is packaged (along with the jar files on which the component depends on),
      and place it all under the
      <code>$PERFCAKE_HOME/lib/plugins</code>
      directory.
