   <title>PerfCake Architecture</title>
   <para>
      In this chapter we describe the inner architecture of PerfCake. First we inspect the overall design and then we delve
      deeper into the individual parts.

   <para>
      There is an easy concept that is good to bear in mind while working with PerfCake -- a single communication unit
      called a <indexterm>Message</indexterm>. PerfCake usually sends the message to the target system and measures the response
      time needed by the system being measured to provide a valid response. It is also the basic unit of load that can be generated
      for the target system.
