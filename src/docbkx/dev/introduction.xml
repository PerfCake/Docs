   <title>Introduction</title>
   <para>PerfCake is a lightweight performance testing framework and a load generator. It has a
      component design which means that you can build up your own performance measurements from some
      basic building blocks. This allows a high flexibility in configuration and the components can
      be reused in different tests. </para>
   <para>PerfCake has a pluggable architecture with many supported interfaces/protocols out of the
      box (HTTP, REST, JMS, JDBC, SOAP, socket, file etc.). If you need support for another
      interface ask our community or provide the implementation. It is really easy as you will find
      later in this guide. </para>
   <para>Except for interfaces/protocols, PerfCake also supports various means of generating the
      load. It can send a preset count of messages, it can send as many messages as the target
      system is able to consume for a given period of time, or it can carefully aim for maximum
      allowable throughput. </para>
   <para>What would be a measurement with proper reports?! PerfCake supports various means of
      reporting the measured values including average throughput (possibly over a time window),
      memory consumption of the target JVM with linear regression analysis to see if there is a
      memory leak and others. There are various output formats supported. Except for console or a
      log file, we support CSV that can be imported as a spreadsheet. In the future we plan to add
      more output formats as the requests arise. </para>
   <para>What if the target system crashed and just quickly returns error messages? There are
      validators that can validate the response to see if everything is OK. With validators you can
      also use PerfCake to write an end-to-end test of your system. Like in case of JDBC - when you
      provide a list of SQL commands and expected results. </para>
   <para>To run PerfCake, one just needs to supply a so called "scenario". This is an XML file that
      describes the building blocks that should be used together. Then you just run the scenario
      using Maven or a prepared shell script if you downloaded just the binaries. We understand the
      need for an IDE plugin and this is one of our short term goals. You can also use PerfCake in
      your application using its API. In future we plan integration with Arquillian and testing
      frameworks including TestNG and jUnit. </para>
   <para>We hope to make your performance testing a real piece of cake! </para>
   <para>This book is further divided into two main parts. This first part describes general
      information useful for all developers and contributors. The second part is intended for core
      developers with major control over the project. It describes release procedure, automatic site
      generation etc. </para>
