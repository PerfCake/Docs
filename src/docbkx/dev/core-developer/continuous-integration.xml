   <title>Continuous Integration</title>
   <para>This chapter describes details about the continuos integration we use at the PerfCake
      project. The target audience are core developers with appropriate access rights.</para>
   <para>As the Continuous Integration system we use Jenkins hosted for free by CloudBees (<link
         xlink:href="https://perfcake.ci.cloudbees.com/"/>). The free conditions require us to log
      in to their system at least once every two weeks which we sometimes forget and it gets
      hibernated. This can explain why you might not find it running. </para>
   <para>We have several important jobs that are typically triggered nightly when there is an update
      to the Git repositories. PerfCake-master and PerfCake-devel jobs build, test, and create
      artifacts for the master and devel branches in the source code. PerfCake-Documentation and
      PerfCake-Documentation-Devel jobs build documentation for the released and for master branch
      in Git.</para>
   <para>Currently, the tests consume more than 64MB of memory and are required to run on large
      slave instances.</para>
