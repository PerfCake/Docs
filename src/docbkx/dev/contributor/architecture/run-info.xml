   <title>Run Info</title>
   <para><varname>RunInfo</varname> is a central object that controls the run of the performance
            test. It is not intended to be inherited nor extended. It is just a central piece that
            tells us when the test started, for how long it runs, when it should finish and how many
            iteration have already passed since the test start.</para>
      <para><varname>RunInfo</varname> typically originates in the scenario definition. The scenario
            can specify the length of the performance test in either a time unit (milliseconds) or
            number of iterations (how many messages should be sent).</para>
      <para><varname>RunInfo</varname> is passed to many other objects in PerfCake but it is not
            supposed to be modified. It is a good practice to use it just for obtaining information
            about the running test by using its getters.</para>
