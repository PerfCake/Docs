   <title>Accumulators</title>
      <para>An <varname>Accumulator</varname> is a tool for reporters to accumulate multiple values
            from <varname>MeasurementUnits</varname> into a single <varname>Mesurement</varname>. </para>
      <para>The <varname>Accumulator</varname> must be thread-safe as it is called from multiple
            threads at the same time.</para>
      <para>It has three simple methods to reset the <varname>Accumulator</varname> to the
            default/empty state (<varname>reset()</varname>), to accumulate a new value
                  (<varname>add()</varname>), and to obtain the current result
                  (<varname>getResult()</varname>).</para>
      <para>The <varname>Accumulator</varname> is not obliged to remember all the added values as
            long as it is capable of providing the correct results. E.g. while counting an average,
            it is sufficient to store the sum and the count of added values. In some cases, it might
            be necessary to store them all (e.g. harmonic mean).</para>
