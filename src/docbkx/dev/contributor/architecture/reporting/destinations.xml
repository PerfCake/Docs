   <title>Destinations</title>
      <para>A <varname>Destination</varname> is a channel to which performance measurement results
            can be reported. The <varname>Destination</varname> is registered with a
                  <varname>Reporter</varname> and is completely controlled by the
                  <varname>Reporter</varname>. The only responsibility of the
                  <varname>Destination</varname> is to open a reporting channel, report
                  <varname>Measurements</varname>, and close the reporting channel. </para>
      <para>It is the role of the <varname>Measurement</varname> object to provide all the
            information to be reported (including value types, names, units and custom
            labels).</para>
      <para>The core method of the <varname>Destination</varname> is <varname>report()</varname> and
            it needs to be thread-safe as it is used by multiple threads at the same time.</para>
      <para>One of the simplest <varname>Destinations</varname> is
                  <varname>ConsoleDestination</varname>. </para>
