   <para>The <varname>SenderTask</varname> instance measures the time needed to send a message by
      using a <varname>MessageSender</varname>. It creates a <varname>MeasurementUnit</varname>
      which is the basic unit carrying a single measurement. The information stored in the
         <varname>MeasurementUnit</varname> are mainly time values of the events in the process of
      sending a request.</para>
   <para>All the <varname>MeasurementUnits</varname> are immediately reported to the
         <varname>ReportManager</varname> which in turn reports this unit to all its
         <varname>Reporters</varname>. A <varname>Reporter</varname> is supposed to process the
      value as it needs. The <varname>Reporter</varname> typically accumulates (by utilizing
         <varname>Accumulators</varname>) the values for later because not all
         <varname>MesurementUnits</varname> are reported to the output (from practical reasons like
      the number of records and performance impacts).</para>
   <para>When it is the right time for the <varname>Reporter</varname> to report the
         <varname>Measurement</varname> to the output (as specified in the scenario configuration by
      using the reporting <varname>Period</varname>), it must publish the results. It is up to the
         <varname>Reporter</varname> to make sure the results are reported at the right
      moments.</para>
   <para>The <varname>Reporter</varname> is supposed to create a <varname>Measurement</varname>
      object carrying the accumulated results and pass it to all its
      <varname>Destinations</varname>.</para>
   <para>The <varname>Destination</varname> is a representation of the place where the results
      should be reported. It can be a terminal console, a comma-separeted values (CSV) file, a chart
      or any custom result repository.</para>
