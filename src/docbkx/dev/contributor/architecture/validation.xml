   <title>Validators</title>
   <para>In this section we will reveal as much details about validators as possible. First we
      describe the architecture and then we discuss an approach to develop new validators. </para>
   <para>Please note that the process of validation can have a significant impact on the performance

      validate suspicious results.</para>
