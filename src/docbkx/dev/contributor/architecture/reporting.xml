   <title>Reporting</title>
   <para>In this section we will reveal as much details about reporting facilities as possible.
      First we describe the architecture and then we discuss an approach to develop new reporters,
      destinations and accumulators. </para>
   <para>Bear in mind that the reporting itself can have a significant influence on the system being
      measured. Be careful when extending this part of PerfCake.</para>
