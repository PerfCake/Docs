   <title>Sequences</title>
   <para>Sequences can be used in any template string loaded from the scenario configuration. They
            are typically used to customize messages in a way that each message sent is unique. </para>
      <para>A <varname>Sequence</varname> only implements two methods. First,
                  <varname>reset()</varname> to reset the <varname>Sequence</varname> to its initial
            state, and second <varname>getNext()</varname> to obtain the next value in the row. The
            Sequences are used heavily by many threads. Therefore they must be thread-safe and
            handle the load smart. </para>
      <para>A wrong example is the <varname>NumberSequence</varname> which has the
                  <varname>getNext()</varname> method synchronized. This makes a significant
            overhead to the PerfCake performance.</para>
      <para>Much better example is the <varname>PrimitiveNumberSequence</varname> which uses
                  <varname>AtomicLong</varname> internally.</para>
