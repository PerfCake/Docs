   <title>Sequences</title>
   <para>Sequences can be used in any template string loaded from the scenario configuration. They
            are typically used to customize messages in a way that each message sent is unique. </para>
      <para>A <varname>Sequence</varname> only implements two methods. First,
                  <varname>reset()</varname> to reset the <varname>Sequence</varname> to its initial
            state, and second <varname>publishNext()</varname> to publish the next value(s) in the
            row to the provided properties. The Sequences are used heavily by many threads.
            Therefore they must be thread-safe and handle the load smart. </para>
      <para>A wrong example is the <varname>NumberSequence</varname> which has the
                  <varname>publishNext()</varname> method synchronized. This makes a significant
            overhead to the PerfCake performance.</para>
      <para>Much better example is the <varname>PrimitiveNumberSequence</varname> which uses
                  <varname>AtomicLong</varname> internally.</para>
      <para>Each sequence can publish more values at once, each having its own unique key prefixed
            with the value from the <code>sequenceId</code> parameter of the
                  <code>publishNext()</code> method.</para>
