   <title>Generators</title>
   <para>In this section we will reveal as much details about message generators as possible. First
      we describe the architecture and then we discuss an approach to develop a new generator. </para>
   <para>Generator is the most sensitive and fragile component in the whole PerfCake architecture.
      It has the reponsibility of generating all the messages and load. It is recommended to study
      the <varname>MessageGenerator</varname> interface, <varname>AbstractMessageGenerator</varname>
      as its basic implementation and then the default implementation called
         <varname>DefaultMessageGenerator</varname> before developing your own generator.</para>
