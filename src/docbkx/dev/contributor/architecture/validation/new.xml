   <title>Writing a New Validator</title>
   <para>The <varname>MessageValidator</varname> interface is the easiest to implement in PerfCake.
            It only has s ingle method, it does not need to be thread-safe because it is always
            called from a single thread in parallel to the running test. It should not perform any
            resource demanding tasks.</para>
      <para>By default, before the scenario execution has finished, there is only a single call to
            the <varname>MessageValidator</varname> every 500ms (unless configured otherwise). After
            that, the validation runs without no pauses.</para>
      <para>The single method is <varname>isValid()</varname> and returns <varname>true</varname> on
            successful message validation. There is no common abstract ancestor and you are supposed
            to implement the interface directly.</para>
