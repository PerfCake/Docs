   <title>PerfCake Architecture</title>
   <para>In this chapter we describe the inner architecture of PerfCake. First we inspect the
      overall design and then we delve deeper into the individual parts.
   </para>
   <para>There is an easy concept that is good to bear in mind while working with PerfCake -- a
      single communication unit called a Message
      <indexterm>
         <primary>Message</primary>
      </indexterm>
      .
      PerfCake usually sends the message to the target system and measures the
      response time needed by the system being measured to provide a valid response. It is also the
      basic unit of load that can be generated for the target system.
   </para>
   <para>Let's investigate the architecture in more details.</para>
