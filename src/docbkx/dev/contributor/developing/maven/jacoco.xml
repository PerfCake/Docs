   <title>JaCoCo Code Coverage</title>
   <para>JaCoCo is configured to use a Java Agent so no class instrumentation is neede. The agent
      is automatically switched on for running tests. The only goal needed is report generation
      (jacoco:report) which must be done together or after test execution.
   </para>

      The resulting report can be found in the
