   <title>Writing Guides</title>
   <para>This section describes guidelines to writing PerfCake guides. It contains information on
      styles used, language, and good practices. </para>
   <para>The documentation is written using Doctype which with all its limitations has been proven
      as the most suitable for generating both PDF and HTML documentation. We receive support from
      oXygen in the form of free licenses for oXygen XML editor which facilitates authoring.</para>
   <para>The documentation is separated into two books. First, the Users' Guide is intended for
      general PerfCake users, while the second, the Developers' Guide is for more advanced users
      willing to extend PerfCake, work with its source code or to make direct contributions.</para>
   <para>There is not much to say about it, as the current document structure and XML elements used
      are a leading example of how to write the documentation. We would like to kindly ask any
      contributors to stick to the current format.</para>
   <para>The documentation is stored in a separate repository on GitHub (<link
         xlink:href="https://github.com/PerfCake/Doc"/>). The main authoring happens in the
         <emphasis>master</emphasis> branch and a new branch is created for each major release. We
      do not use tags as we want to keep the option to fix any issues even after the release.
      However, given the limited resources, this happens only rarely. The documentation is valid for
      just the latest minor release in the given branch.</para>
