   <title>DictionaryValidator (TODO: describe)</title>
   <para>
      Dictionary validator can create a dictionary of valid responses and use this to validate them in another run.
      It is also possible to create the dictionary manually, however, this is to complicated task and we always
      recommend running the validation in record mode first. Any manual changes can be done later.

   <para>
      The validator creates an index file and a separate file for each response. A writable directory must
      be specified using the <code>dictionaryDirectory</code> property. The default index file name can be redefined. The response file names are based on hash codes of
      he original messages. Empty, null or equal messages will overwrite the file but this is not the intended use
      of this validator. Index file is never overwritten, if you really insist on recreating it, please rename or
      delete the file manually (this is for safety reasons).
      It is not sufficient to store just the index as it is likely that the correct messages will be manually
      modified after they are recorded.
