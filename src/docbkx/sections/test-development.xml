   <title>Test Development</title>
   <para> All classes in PerfCake are supposed to have a good test coverage. This might not
      currently be the situation for all of them but it definitely is our goal. When developing new
      code, please make sure the tests are developed as well.</para>
   <para>There are the following test groups defined. Each of the test methods or classes should be
      categorized at least into one of them.</para>
   <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para><emphasis>unit</emphasis> - Test of a single component (class).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para><emphasis>integration</emphasis> - Tests of multiple components working well in the
            complete context of PerfCake and in relation to other components.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para><emphasis>performance</emphasis> - Tests of a perfomance of a component or multiple
            components to make sure they are not a bottle-neck.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para><emphasis>stress</emphasis> - Tests to verify that a component or multiple components
            work correctly under a heavy load.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para><emphasis>ueber</emphasis> - Advanced integration/performance/stress tests that
            verify components at larger scale than previous groups and take significant amount of
            time. Tests in this group are not executed by default, unless a Maven profile
               <emphasis>allTests</emphasis> is used.</para>
      </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>To find out what is the current code coverage of tests, refer to the <xref
         linkend="maven-goals"/>.</para>
